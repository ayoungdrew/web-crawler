# GE Digital - Web Crawler Code Challenge

## Intro
The challenge was to create a web crawler/graph traversal function. Inputs and expected outputs were provided by GE Digital team.

## Installation

Requires installation of depdendencies for testing:

```
npm install
```

## Notes
Tests focus on testing the depth of the graph traversal, particularly if page objects in the pages array were re-arranged to be less linear.
